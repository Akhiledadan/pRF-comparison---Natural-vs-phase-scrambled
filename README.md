# pRFModel_naturalImageProcessing
Using pRF model to understand the neural mechanism underlying natural image processing

Matlab scripts used for the project - "Early extra-striate cortex supports receptive field interactions to process natural images"

Contains scripts to - run population receptive (pRF) model, analyze pRF properties for natural and phase scrambled conditions,
and generate the figures in the manuscript.
